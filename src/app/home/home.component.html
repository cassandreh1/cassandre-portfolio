    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello world! My name is Cassandre Henriquez a millennial woman whom was
      born in Brooklyn, NY, but grew up in Haiti. After the devastating 2010
      earthquake, I moved to Wellington, Palm Beach, FL.
      I completed high school and attended Palm beach state college. Once I received my AA degree I transferred to Florida
      Atlantic University and graduated with Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
      <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly at first
      I was not sure which track I wanted to follow as a CS major, this IT world is so vast! It wasnâ€™t until I took a
      course on web development that I found my niche.
      I love the user interaction aspect and bringing a website and web application to life. I enjoy seeing creative websites that push
      my CSS
      skills.
      <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;The last 3 years of career, I have worked in the FSI (Finanical Services and Insurance) industry. And I wanted to create this profilio
      to showcase my skills and upskill (forever a developer's jounery). Feel free to check out my web site. <fa-icon [icon]="faLaughBeam"></fa-icon>

    <p>Sincerly, </p>
