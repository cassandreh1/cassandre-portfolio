    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;Bonjour le Monde! I’m Cassandre Henriquez, born in Brooklyn,
      and raised in Haiti. Following the devastating 2010 earthquake in Haiti,
      my family relocated to Wellington, Palm Beach, FL where I graduated high school.
      Upon graduation I initially enrolled at Palm Beach State College later transferring
      to Florida Atlantic University where I majored in and graduated with a degree in Computer Science.
      Initially, I was unsure which path I wanted to follow as a CS major (vast IT universe)!
       It wasn’t until I took a web development class that I found my niche. I enjoy bringing 
       a website/web application to life and working on creative websites that push my CSS skills.
    </p> 
     <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp;I have spent the past three years as a developer in different 
        capacities in FSI (Financial Services and Insurance) industry. This portfolio 
        showcases my skills and upskill (forever a developer’s journey). 
        Check it out and reach out!
    </p>
    <p>Sincerly, </p>
