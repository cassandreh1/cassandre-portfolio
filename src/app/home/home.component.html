    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello world! My name is Cassandre Henriquez a Haitian-American millennial woman.
      I was born in Brooklyn, NY, but grow up in Port-au-Prince,Ayiti(Haiti).After the devastating 2010 Haitian
      earthquake, I moved to Wellington, Palm Beach,
      FL and completed high school. I then attended a
      community college, Palm beach state college. Once I received my AA degree I transferred to Florida
      Atlantic University and earned my bachelors degree in Computer Science.
      <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Honestly at first
      I was not sure which track I wanted to follow as a CS major, this IT world is so vast! It wasn’t until I took a
      course on web development that I found my niche.
      I love the UI aspect and bring a website and web application to life. I enjoy seeing creative websites that push
      my CSS
      skills.
      <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Given majority of my career is base in the FSI industry, I wanted to create this profilio
      to showcase my skills and upskill (forever a developer's jounery). Feel free to check out my site. :)
    </p>
    <p>Sincerly, </p>

    <!--Without saying my current role is a front- end developer contractor for Wells Fargo. No worries guys 
      I’ve created a page for my resume , please refer to it if your curious about my work experience. 

      <br><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;Now on to the purpose of the website. I decided to create a website basically to build on my MEAN 
      stack skill sets. Because I work for Wells a lot of actual code and work is not available for the public 
      eye. It’s ok because this is where I get to show you all my hard work and it’s all on my terms. 
      Now keep it mind this is my personal project so the terms are set by me. Hope I can inspire someone 
      out there while still figuring out who I am. </p> -->
